                                              - FED WITH FOOD, HOPE &LOVE
                                             “Sharing food moves mountains.” 
As per ancient Indian wisdom, food is hailed as nectar and wastage of food is considered a sin.

India is ranked 107 out of 121 countries in the Global Hunger Index 2022. With a score of 29.1, the level of hunger in India has been labelled “serious”.
According to a recent study, an average person in India wastes 137 grams of food, every single day; that’s 0.9 kg per week or 50 kgs per year. In India, 40% of food is wasted, which is equivalent to Rs. 92,000 crores a year.

With this in mind, we will be developing an application, called Hanker (which translates into “a strong desire to do something.”) It is centered on collecting leftover, good quality food from caterers(hotels), weddings & events and distributing them to the underprivileged, through our platform. Our application will employ penetrative pricing strategy for delivery in which we’ll offer the service at a low price to attract the attention of the target market. We’ll also offer advertisement possibilities to caterers and event planners.

By concentrating on distribution of food rather than delivery, we plan to build connections with event organizers and wedding planners to achieve massive food surpluses, thereby preventing wastage of food. 

In order to assure the quality of food, we’ll attain food from catering services with 3-stars and above.

By contributing to this cause, event planners or catering services (hotels and restaurants) can obtain badges which will help them further promote their businesses, since this encourages a larger section of the society to contribute indirectly.

We aim to implement the functionality using HTML, JavaScript, python, CSS and MySQL by means of a relevant report on orphanages, old age homes, animal shelters, etc., as well as the quantity of food required and delivery time.

So, stopping the wastage of food is one single step that can make our country and planet a better place to live. It is a very easy habit that needs a small tweaking of our existing habits of how we consume and distribute our surplus food.
